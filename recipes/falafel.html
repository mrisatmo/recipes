    <h1>Falafel</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Unlike most of America's other favorite fast foods, falafel is rarely attempted at home, which is a shame, since it's very simple to do, and even a relative novice like me can get some very decent results. One word of warning: you do need to know you're going to have a craving for this a full day before you actually want to eat it.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dry garbanzo beans</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
         <li>garbanzo beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 12 to 24 hours. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Blend garbanzo beans, onion, parsley, garlic, flour, lemon juice, salt, cumin, coriander, baking soda, and cayenne pepper together in a food processor, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until mixture is finely ground and holds together when pressed. Transfer garbanzo mixture to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until flavors blend, 1 to 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Divide dough into 12 portions and roll each with moistened hands into a ball.
        </li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook falafel balls in hot oil until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.
        </li>
    </ol>
